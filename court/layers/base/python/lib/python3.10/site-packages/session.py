TODO:
Rate Limiting: Even if you're protected against SQL-injections,
without some form of rate limiting in place, you're still susceptible to brute-force or flooding attacks.
Someone might try to overwhelm your service by sending a large number of requests in a short period.
AWS Lambda, for instance, will scale to meet demand, which could lead to higher costs.
It would be advisable to implement some form of rate limiting sooner rather than later to avoid unexpected spikes in costs.

Rate limiting can be set at various levels, but for Lambda, you can:

- Set a concurrent execution limit on the function.
  This will cap the number of instances of your function that can be run simultaneously.

- Use API Gateway's built-in rate limiting features.
  If your Lambdas are exposed via API Gateway,
  it offers built-in throttling settings which can be used to specify how many requests per second
  a caller can make and to set a standard rate and burst rate for all API methods.

[ ] Enforcing HTTPS:

On AWS, you can enforce HTTPS at the load balancer (if using one), API Gateway, or within the application itself by setting up a redirect from HTTP to HTTPS.
If you're using API Gateway, it supports HTTPS by default and doesn't allow HTTP connections, so thereâ€™s nothing extra you need to do.

[ ] CORS: Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) properly to restrict which domains can make requests to your server.
